The Network Dynamics presentation was created to provide a glimpse into the functioning of the Synereo network and its attention model, governing how information flows through the wires. Slide by slide, the presentation walks through typical scenarios on the network, showcasing how it self-organizes based on the activity of users and on where they place their attention.

The second chapter, released today, deals with Synereo's tool for organizing the content stream around interests and communities. These operate as something between a hashtag and a group, and for now, we're calling these entities "Synereos".

Synereos have functionality beyond what you may be used to in other social networks. Active users of Synereos will have many options to choose from when customizing their communities, deciding about them in democratic fashion. This allows Synereo users to control what types of information can be shared to it, how in group decisions are made, how content may be moderated, and - since Synereo is very extensible - any other aspect of their online interaction they wish to tinker with.
